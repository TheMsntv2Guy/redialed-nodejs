## Notes for service configuration
`includes/config.json` can be used as a reference for what settings you can configure. Though be warned, it's supposed to contain configuration info applied to *all* instances. `user_config.json` is for this specific instance. Please take care before modifying either. This is being done to reduce clashing between configs and eliminate potential for misconfiguration.

Please make sure of the following:
- Service IP is correct and the service can be accessed from it
- Guest users are *not* enabled
- Registration is open on public services
- Appropriate API keys are functional for things like time zone determination
